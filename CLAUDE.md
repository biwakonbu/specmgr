This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Local DocSearch & Chat Assistant** - A system for managing Git-local Markdown documents with hybrid search (text + vector) and Claude Code SDK integration

### Documentation References
- **Technical Stack**: See @techstack.md for comprehensive technology selection rationale and architecture decisions
- **Product Requirements**: See @PRD.md for detailed functional and non-functional requirements

### Architecture
- **File Watcher (Python)**: Markdown file change monitoring with watchdog
- **Text Search Engine**: Local full-text search with relevance scoring
- **Claude Code SDK**: Chat functionality with document context
- **React UI**: Three-pane resizable layout with URL-based navigation
- **History API Integration**: Browser-native navigation with state persistence

### Tech Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI + AsyncIO
- Frontend: React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + react-markdown
- Search: Hybrid search system (Local text search + Qdrant vector search)
- Embeddings: Claude Code SDK for semantic embeddings (subscription required)
- Chat: Claude Code SDK Python for streaming responses (subscription required)
- Vector Database: Qdrant for semantic search
- Queue: Redis for async processing
- File Watching: watchdog (Python)
- Streaming: SSE (Server-Sent Events)

## Development Guidelines

### Synchronization Flow Implementation Principles
1. **File Change Detection**: watchdog (Python) monitors Markdown files in real-time
2. **SHA-1 Manifest System**: `.specmgr-manifest.json` tracks file hashes for differential sync
3. **Differential Processing**: Only process changed, added, or deleted files (97%+ DB load reduction)
4. **Asynchronous Queue**: Redis queue with auto-retry (5 attempts, exponential backoff)
5. **Embedding Generation**: Claude Code SDK for semantic vectors (subscription required)
6. **Database Indexing**: Store in both Qdrant vector DB and text search index
7. **Atomic Manifest Updates**: Update manifest only after successful processing
8. **Force Sync Option**: `force=true` bypasses manifest for full re-sync

### UI Layout Specifications
- Left Pane (20%): DocTree (File tree + shadcn/ui) - Resizable (10-40%)
- Center Pane (55%): MarkdownPane (react-markdown + Enhanced Mermaid) - Auto-adjusts
- Right Pane (25%): ChatPane (LLM Q&A + SSE) - Resizable (15-50%)
- Drag handles between panes for user customization

### Enhanced Mermaid Diagram Rendering
- **Nord Dark Theme**: Complete integration with 140+ color variables
- **Animated Edges**: Flowing light effects along connection paths
- **Smart Edge Coloring**: 
  - Flowcharts: Source node type-based coloring (Frontend=Blue, API=Cyan, Services=Teal, etc.)
  - Sequence diagrams: Consistent golden edges with distinct actor styling
  - Automatic fallback for other diagram types
- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Subgraph padding and styling
  - Professional drop shadows and glow effects
  - Optimized edge thickness and dash patterns
  - High-performance animations (0.8s linear infinite)
- **URL Navigation**: Browser History API integration for file selection state
- **Chat UI**: Compact design with 12px base font, enlarged 8x8px avatars, 98% message width

### CSS-Free Development Approach
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-paste components with Tailwind CSS - no custom CSS needed
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible components as foundation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling - minimal CSS maintenance required

### Performance Requirements
- Vector search response: < 1.5 seconds (95th percentile)
- Text search fallback: < 0.5 seconds 
- Sync job success rate: 99%+
- Single file change reflection: < 5 seconds (including embedding generation)
- **Differential sync efficiency**: 97%+ reduction in DB operations for unchanged files
- **Manifest operations**: < 50ms for file change detection (JSON-based)

### Security Policy
- Local environment only operation
- External communication limited to Claude Code SDK API (TLS required)
- Prohibition of confidential information external transmission
- API key stored securely in environment variables

- **Relevance scoring**: Normalized 0-1 score with multiple factors

### Manifest-Based Differential Sync System

#### SHA-1 Manifest Implementation
- **Manifest File**: `.specmgr-manifest.json` in docs directory
- **File Tracking**: SHA-1 hash of each Markdown file for change detection
- **JSON Structure**: `{"files": {"path/to/file.md": "sha1hash"}, "last_updated": "ISO8601"}`
- **Atomic Updates**: Manifest updated only after successful DB operations

#### Differential Sync Process
1. **Hash Calculation**: Generate SHA-1 for all current Markdown files
2. **Change Detection**: Compare with manifest to identify:
   - **Added files**: New files not in manifest
   - **Modified files**: Files with different SHA-1 hashes
   - **Deleted files**: Files in manifest but not on filesystem
3. **Selective Processing**: Only process changed files (97%+ DB load reduction)
4. **Manifest Update**: Update hashes after successful processing

#### Performance Benefits
- **Before**: 100 files â†’ 100 DB operations (every sync)
- **After**: 3 changed files â†’ 3 DB operations (97% reduction)
- **Manifest Operations**: < 50ms for change detection
- **Memory Efficient**: Lightweight JSON-based tracking

#### Operational Features
- **Force Sync**: `force=true` bypasses manifest for complete re-indexing
- **Corruption Recovery**: Auto-reset to empty manifest on JSON corruption
- **Statistics**: Manifest size, file count, last update tracking
- **Clear Function**: Manual manifest reset for troubleshooting

#### FileWatcher Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: File changes trigger individual manifest updates
- **Queue Processing**: Changed files processed via Redis queue
- **Debouncing**: Prevent duplicate processing with 1-second cooldown

- **File Hash Failures**: Continue processing with warnings for unreadable files
- **Atomic Operations**: Rollback manifest updates on sync failures
- Exponential backoff retry on Redis queue job failures
- Auto-recovery functionality during network outages
- Logging and monitoring for sync failures

### URL Navigation & State Management
- **History API Integration**: Seamless browser navigation without page reloads
- **URL State Persistence**: File selection preserved in URL query parameters (`?file=path`)
- **Browser Navigation**: Back/forward buttons work naturally with file selection
- **Bookmarkable URLs**: Direct file access via URL sharing

## Development Principles

### Python Environment Management
- **Python Version**: 3.12+ (specified in `.python-version`)
- **Package Manager**: uv (modern, fast Python package manager)
- **Virtual Environment**: Managed by uv (`uv venv`, `uv sync`)
- **Dependencies**: Defined in `pyproject.toml` with proper version constraints
- **Development Dependencies**: Separate dev group for testing and linting tools

### Python Development Workflow
1. **Environment Setup**: `uv venv` to create virtual environment
2. **Dependencies**: `uv sync` to install all dependencies
3. **Development**: `uv run python main.py` to start server
4. **Testing**: `uv run pytest` for test execution
5. **Linting**: `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format`
6. **Type Checking**: `uv run mypy .` for static analysis

### Language and Documentation Guidelines
- Write all documentation, commits, comments, docstrings, and system messages in English

## Critical Development Standards

### Warning and Feedback Response Policy
**Always respond to warnings and feedback with sincere consideration - never force through resistance**

#### Core Principle: Respect System Feedback
When any system (pre-commit hooks, linters, tests, etc.) raises warnings or errors:
- **Listen carefully** to what the warning is communicating
- **Take time** to understand the underlying issue
- **Address the root cause** rather than bypassing symptoms
- **Never force through** when systems indicate problems

#### Lesson Learned (2025-01-26)
**Issue**: After implementing a comprehensive pre-commit warning system that clearly stated "These are NOT minor issues", immediately used `--no-verify` to bypass 127 lint errors without addressing them.

**Root Problem**: Failed to practice what was preached - ignored own implementation of quality standards.

**Key Insight**: Warnings exist for important reasons. When systems push back, it's usually because there's a legitimate concern that needs attention.

**Better Approach**: 
- When warnings appear, pause and truly listen
- Understand why the system is raising concerns
- Address issues systematically rather than bypassing them
- Recognize that "forcing through" often creates technical debt
- If bypass is necessary, ensure it's for valid reasons with user agreement

**Mindset**: Warnings are guidance from experienced developers embedded in tools - treat them as valuable input, not obstacles to overcome.

## Language and Interaction Guidelines

### Language Interaction Principles
- Claude Code will communicate in the language used by the user
- Programming-related discussions will be conducted in English
- Project memories and documentation will be written in English
- When interacting with users, adapt to their preferred language
