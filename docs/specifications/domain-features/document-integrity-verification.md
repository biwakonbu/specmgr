## Business Logic

### Integrity Verification Algorithm
1. **Content Hash Verification**:
   ```fsharp
   let verifyContentIntegrity (filePath: string) (expectedHash: string option) =
       let currentContent = File.ReadAllText(filePath)
       let currentHash = SHA256.HashData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(currentContent))
       let currentHashString = Convert.ToHexString(currentHash)
       
       match expectedHash with
       | Some expected -> currentHashString = expected
       | None -> true // Cannot verify without reference
   ```

2. **Signature Validation**:
   ```fsharp
   let validateSignature (filePath: string) (signatureInfo: SignatureInfo) (secretKey: string) =
       let currentContent = File.ReadAllText(filePath)
       let expectedSignature = generateHMAC currentContent signatureInfo.SignedBy signatureInfo.SignedAt secretKey
       expectedSignature = signatureInfo.Signature
   ```

3. **Change Detection Logic**:
   ```fsharp
   let detectChanges (currentContent: string) (referenceContent: string) =
       let currentLines = currentContent.Split('\n')
       let referenceLines = referenceContent.Split('\n')
       
       // Implement Myers diff algorithm or similar
       computeDifferences currentLines referenceLines
   ```

### Risk Assessment Matrix
```yaml
risk_levels:
  metadata_changes:
    status_change: "critical"      # Lifecycle status modifications
    version_change: "high"         # Version number changes
    author_change: "medium"        # Author/ownership changes
    timestamp_change: "low"        # Timestamp updates
    
  content_changes:
    requirements_removal: "critical"    # Removing requirements
    security_weakening: "critical"      # Reducing security measures
    api_breaking_changes: "high"        # Breaking API changes
    requirement_addition: "medium"      # Adding new requirements
    clarification: "low"                # Text clarifications
    
  signature_issues:
    missing_signature: "high"           # No signature for approved spec
    invalid_signature: "critical"       # Signature verification failure
    expired_signature: "medium"         # Time-based expiration
    weak_algorithm: "medium"            # Deprecated crypto algorithms
```

### Verification Confidence Scoring
```fsharp
let calculateConfidenceScore (verificationResult: IntegrityResult) =
    let mutable score = 1.0
    
    // Reduce confidence based on issues
    if not verificationResult.ContentIntegrity.HashMatch then
        score <- score * 0.0  // Complete failure
    
    if verificationResult.SignatureIntegrity.Status = "invalid" then
        score <- score * 0.1  // Severe trust issue
    
    if verificationResult.SignatureIntegrity.Status = "missing" then
        score <- score * 0.7  // Moderate trust issue
        
    // Age-based confidence reduction
    let ageInDays = (DateTime.UtcNow - verificationResult.SignatureIntegrity.SigningTimestamp).TotalDays
    if ageInDays > 90.0 then
        score <- score * 0.9  // Slight reduction for old signatures
        
    Math.Max(0.0, Math.Min(1.0, score))
```
