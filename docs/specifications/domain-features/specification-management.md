# Specification Management Feature

## Ubiquitous Language
- **Specification**: A formal document defining requirements, features, or implementation details
- **Oracle**: The system that provides authoritative answers about specifications
- **Validation**: Process of checking compliance with specifications
- **Deviation**: Implementation that doesn't match specification
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary used consistently across documentation and code
- **Signature**: Cryptographic proof that specification was updated through proper channels

## Business Description
Provide a comprehensive system for managing, querying, and validating specifications throughout the development lifecycle.

## Business Rules
1. All specification changes must go through the Oracle system
2. Direct file edits to specifications are prohibited
3. Every specification change requires a cryptographic signature
4. Implementations must use terms defined in ubiquitous language
5. Deviations from specifications must be detected and reported

## User Workflow
1. Developer queries Oracle for specification details
2. Oracle searches and provides authoritative answer
3. Developer implements according to specification
4. Oracle validates implementation compliance
5. Any deviations are reported with specific guidance

## Functional Requirements
- Natural language specification queries
- AI-driven investigation of related specifications
- Cryptographic signing of specification updates
- Real-time validation of naming conventions
- Integration with existing RAG infrastructure
