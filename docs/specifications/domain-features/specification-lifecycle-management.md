# Specification Lifecycle Management

## Overview

A feature for managing specification document lifecycle state transitions. Executes state changes according to defined transition rules and provides approval processes, condition validation, and audit trails.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. State Transition Execution
**Purpose**: Transition specification documents to the next lifecycle stage

**Input**:
- Specification file path
- Target status (review, approved, implementing, implemented, verified, deprecated)
- Actor information (user email, role)
- Optional: Transition reason/comment
- Optional: Force flag for emergency overrides

**Output**:
- Success confirmation with new status
- Updated metadata in specification file
- Git commit with transition record
- Audit log entry

**Business Rules**:
- Only allow valid transition paths (following specification-operation-flow.md)
- Must satisfy prerequisites for each transition
- Verify appropriate permissions for transitions requiring approval
- Execute state changes as atomic operations

### 2. Transition Condition Validation
**Purpose**: Pre-validate the feasibility of state transitions

**Input**:
- Specification file path
- Target status
- Actor information

**Output**:
- Boolean: Whether transition is possible
- Detailed condition check results
- List of blocking factors
- Required approvals or actions
- Estimated time to resolution

**Business Rules**:
- Systematically validate all transition conditions
- Consider dependent specification status
- Specifically identify missing requirements
- Report non-blocking warnings as well

### 3. Approval Process Management
**Purpose**: Execute approval processes for transitions requiring approval

**Input**:
- Specification file path
- Transition request details
- Approver information
- Approval decision (approve/reject/request_changes)
- Optional: Approval comments

**Output**:
- Approval record creation
- Status update (if fully approved)
- Notification to relevant stakeholders
- Audit trail entry

**Business Rules**:
- Verify role-based approval requirements
- Handle collective approval when multiple approvers required
- Manage approval expiration and re-approval requirements
- Handle rejection processing and feedback loops

### 4. Bulk State Management
**Purpose**: Manage states for multiple specification documents in batch

**Input**:
- File pattern or directory path
- Target status
- Selection criteria (current status, tags, etc.)
- Actor information
- Optional: Confirmation mode

**Output**:
- Batch operation results
- Success/failure count
- Failed items with error details
- Summary of changes made

**Business Rules**:
- Individual validation per file
- Atomic transactions for related specifications
- Rollback capability on partial failures
- Progress tracking for large batches

## State Transition Rules

### Valid Transition Paths
```

  specification_path: "specifications/user-management/registration.yaml"
  from_status: "review"
  to_status: "approved"
  actor: "tech-lead@example.com"
  actor_role: "technical_lead"
  timestamp: "2025-01-26T10:00:00Z"
  reason: "Security review completed successfully"
  force_override: false
```

### Transition Result

  success: true
  specification_path: "specifications/user-management/registration.yaml"

```

## Business Logic

### Transition Validation Engine
1. **Pre-condition Checks**:
   - Current status verification
   - Actor permission validation
   - Required field completeness
   - Dependency status verification

2. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - State machine compliance
   - Approval requirements satisfaction
   - Timing constraints (cooling-off periods)
   - Conflict detection with other operations

3. **Post-condition Verification**:
   - Metadata consistency
   - File system state alignment
   - Git repository state consistency
   - Audit trail completeness

### Approval Workflow Engine
1. **Role-based Approval Matrix**:
   ```yaml
   approval_matrix:
     requirements:
       review_to_approved: ["product_owner"]
     domain_features:
       review_to_approved: ["domain_expert", "technical_lead"]
     system_features:
       review_to_approved: ["technical_lead", "architect"]
   ```

2. **Approval Aggregation Logic**:
   - Sequential approvals for dependent roles
   - Parallel approvals for independent roles
   - Quorum-based decisions for committee approvals
   - Veto power for security-critical changes

3. **Approval Expiration Handling**:
   - Time-based expiration (default: 30 days)
   - Change-based invalidation
   - Automatic re-approval requests
   - Escalation procedures

## Integration Points
