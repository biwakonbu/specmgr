# Document Digital Signing

## Overview

A feature for generating and managing cryptographic digital signatures for specification documents. Provides signature lifecycle for approval process proof, document authenticity assurance, and tampering prevention.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Signature Generation
**Purpose**: Generate digital signatures for specification documents and create approval evidence

**Input**:
- Specification file path
- Signer identity (email, role)
- Signing reason/context
- Optional: Signature expiration time
- Optional: Additional metadata

**Output**:
- Generated signature file
- Signature metadata record
- Verification instructions
- Signing timestamp
- Success confirmation

**Business Rules**:
- Use HMAC-SHA256 algorithm
- Signer authority verification required
- Confirmation before overwriting existing signatures
- Accurately record file content at signing time

### 2. Signature Management
**Purpose**: Manage existing signatures (update, revoke, re-sign)

**Input**:

- Management operation (renew, revoke, update)
- Authorized actor information
- Operation reason
- Optional: New expiration time

**Output**:
- Updated signature status
- Operation audit record
- Affected stakeholder notifications
- Rollback information if needed

**Business Rules**:
- Only approvers can execute signature revocation
- Re-signing executable by original signer or higher authority

## Business Logic

### Signature Generation Algorithm
```fsharp
let generateSignature (filePath: string) (signerInfo: SignerInfo) (secretKey: string) =
    // 1. Read and normalize file content
    let content = File.ReadAllText(filePath).Replace("\r\n", "\n")
    let contentHash = SHA256.HashData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content))
    
    // 2. Create signing payload
    let timestamp = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
    let payload = $"{filePath}|{Convert.ToHexString(contentHash)}|{timestamp}|{signerInfo.Email}|{signerInfo.Role}"
    
    // 3. Generate HMAC signature
    let signatureBytes = HMACSHA256.HashData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(secretKey), Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(payload))
    let signature = Convert.ToHexString(signatureBytes)
    
    // 4. Create signature record
    {
        SignatureId = $"sig_{timestamp.Replace(":", "").Replace("-", "")}_{Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(filePath)}"
        Algorithm = "HMAC-SHA256"
        SignatureValue = signature
        ContentHash = Convert.ToHexString(contentHash)
        SignerInfo = signerInfo
        ValidFrom = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow
        ExpiresAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMonths(3)
        Status = SignatureStatus.Active
    }
```

### Authority Verification Matrix
```yaml
signing_authority_matrix:
  specification_types:
    requirements:
      draft_to_review: ["product_owner", "domain_expert"]
      review_to_approved: ["product_owner"]
      approved_maintenance: ["product_owner", "technical_lead"]
      
    domain_features:
      draft_to_review: ["domain_expert", "technical_lead"]
      review_to_approved: ["domain_expert", "technical_lead"]
      approved_maintenance: ["domain_expert", "technical_lead", "architect"]
      
    system_features:
      draft_to_review: ["technical_lead", "architect"]
      review_to_approved: ["technical_lead", "architect"]
      approved_maintenance: ["architect", "technical_director"]
      
  emergency_override:
    allowed_roles: ["technical_director", "security_officer"]
    requires_justification: true
    auto_expire_hours: 24
    mandatory_review: true
```

### Signature Expiration Management
```fsharp
let checkSignatureExpiration (signature: DigitalSignature) =
    let now = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow
    let daysUntilExpiry = (signature.ExpiresAt - now).TotalDays
    
    match daysUntilExpiry with
    | d when d < 0.0 -> SignatureStatus.Expired
    | d when d < 7.0 -> SignatureStatus.ExpiringWarn  // Warning period
    | d when d < 30.0 -> SignatureStatus.ExpiringInfo // Info period  
    | _ -> SignatureStatus.Active

let scheduleRenewalNotification (signature: DigitalSignature) =
    let notificationSchedule = [
        (30, "Signature expires in 30 days")
        (7, "Signature expires in 7 days")  
        (1, "Signature expires tomorrow")
        (0, "Signature has expired")
    ]
    
    notificationSchedule
    |> List.map (fun (days, message) -> 
        createScheduledNotification signature.SignerInfo.Email message (signature.ExpiresAt.AddDays(-days)))
```
