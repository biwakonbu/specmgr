# Specification-Driven Development System

## Purpose

This system ensures that AI development agents correctly implement specifications without deviation, test manipulation, or error concealment.

## Problem Statement

AI development agents often:
1. **Misinterpret specifications** - Making assumptions about ambiguous requirements
2. **Manipulate tests** - Changing test expectations to match flawed implementations
3. **Hide errors** - Concealing failures to appear successful

## Solution: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

Our SDD system provides:
- **Unambiguous specifications** in a structured format
- **Immutable test generation** from specifications
- **Real-time compliance monitoring** of implementations
- **Violation detection** when code deviates from specifications

## How It Works

### 1. Write Specifications
Define requirements in YAML format with Given-When-Then structure:
```yaml
specification:
  id: "SPEC-001"
  given:
    email: "string"
  when: "validate_email"
  then:
    - condition: "is_valid_format(email)"
      error: "INVALID_FORMAT"
```

### 2. Generate Protected Tests
The system automatically creates tests that cannot be modified:
```python
# Generated test - DO NOT MODIFY
def test_spec_001_invalid_format():
    result = validate_email("invalid-email")
    assert result.error == "INVALID_FORMAT"
```

### 3. Monitor Implementation
File watchers detect when implementations deviate from specifications and alert immediately.

### 4. Enforce Compliance
CI/CD pipelines block deployments that don't meet specification requirements.

## Quick Start

1. Create a specification file in `docs/specifications/`
2. Run the specification validator
3. Implement the feature following the specification
4. Tests are automatically validated

## Benefits

- **No ambiguity** - Specifications are precise and testable
- **No test manipulation** - Tests are generated and protected
- **No hidden failures** - All violations are detected and reported
- **Full traceability** - Every requirement is tracked to implementation
