# Oracle Validation Service

## Technical Description
Provide validation engine that ensures specifications are followed correctly and prevents unauthorized modifications.

## Technical Requirements

### Specification Integrity
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures for all specification commits
- Git commit verification for spec changes
- Tamper detection through signature validation
- Branch-wide integrity checking

### Implementation Validation
- AST parsing for code analysis
- Naming convention verification
- Cross-reference with ubiquitous language definitions
- Real-time validation feedback

### Integration Requirements
- Git hook integration for pre-commit validation
- CLI tool for manual validation
- IDE plugin support for real-time checking
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Integration Points
- **Uses**: Git for version control, HMAC for signatures
- **Used by**: All development tools and workflows
- **Dependencies**: Specification documents, ubiquitous language definitions
- **API**: CLI commands and programmatic interface

## Performance Requirements
- Single file validation: < 100ms
- Full codebase scan: < 30 seconds
- Real-time IDE feedback: < 50ms

## Security Considerations
- Secret key management for HMAC
- Protection against signature replay attacks
- Audit trail for all validations
