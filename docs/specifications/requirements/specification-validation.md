# Specification Validation Requirements

## Overview
Requirements for a system that ensures AI development agents and developers follow specifications accurately without deviation or test manipulation.

## User Story
As a development team lead, I want to ensure that all implementations strictly follow specifications and that tests accurately reflect requirements, so that quality and consistency are maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System detects when implementations deviate from specifications
2. System prevents test manipulation to hide implementation flaws
3. System enforces ubiquitous language in code naming
4. System provides clear feedback on specification violations
5. System maintains tamper-proof specification documents

## Business Value
- Ensures implementation quality and consistency
- Reduces bugs from specification misinterpretation
- Maintains codebase integrity
- Facilitates team communication through ubiquitous language

## Priority
Critical - This is foundational for maintaining development quality

## Stakeholders
- Development team leads
- QA engineers
- Product owners
- Individual developers using AI agents
