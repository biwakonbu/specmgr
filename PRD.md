# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Name

**Local DocSearch & Chat Assistant**

## 2. Background and Objectives

- *Background*: There is a lack of environments where engineers can instantly perform full-text search, summarization, and Q&A in chat format for locally managed Markdown documents.
- *Objective*: Use Git-managed Markdown as the **single source of truth (SSOT)** and sync only change differentials with vector DB (Qdrant). Enable browsing and chatting on React UI.

## 3. Scope

| Included                        | Excluded               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Local PC operation              | Cloud / SaaS deployment |
| Markdown (`.md`) files     | PDF, Word and other formats    |
| Qdrant / Redis / Python server | External LLM API cost management   |
| URL-based navigation | Complex multi-page routing |

## 4. Target Users / Personas

- **Software Engineers** (individual or small teams)
  - Frequently reference design documents on Git
  - Seek high-speed search and summarization by LLM

## 5. Use Cases (Examples)

1. Engineer wants to check new API specifications → Ask chat for summary without opening files.
2. Edit and save Markdown → Immediately reflect in search results (differential sync).
3. Sync failure (network disconnection) → Confirm recovery through automatic retry.
4. Share specific document → Copy URL and send to colleague for direct access.
5. Navigate between documents → Use browser back/forward buttons naturally.
6. Large codebase with 1000+ docs → Only changed files processed, 97%+ DB load reduction.
7. System restart after manifest corruption → Auto-recovery with empty manifest fallback.

## 6. Core Functional Requirements

| Performance | Vector search < 1.5s, Text search < 0.5s (95th percentile), Differential sync 97%+ DB load reduction |
| Reliability     | Sync job success rate 99%+ (including automatic retry)        |
| Security  | Local environment only. External communication only via Claude Code SDK with TLS |
| Portability     | One-command startup with Docker Compose              |
| Navigation | URL state change < 100ms, browser back/forward support |
| UI Responsiveness | Chat message render < 200ms, compact design for space efficiency |

## 9. Synchronization Flow Details

### 9.1 Differential Sync Process
1. **File Detection**: watchdog detects `add/change/unlink` events
2. **Hash Calculation**: Generate SHA-1 for changed files
3. **Manifest Comparison**: Compare against `.specmgr-manifest.json`
4. **Change Classification**: Identify added/modified/deleted files
5. **Selective Queueing**: Queue only differential changes to Redis (97%+ load reduction)
6. **Processing**: Worker generates embeddings → Qdrant Upsert/Delete (attempts=5, exponential back-off)
7. **Atomic Update**: Update manifest only after successful processing

### 9.2 Manifest Structure
```json
{
  "files": {
    "docs/api.md": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
    "docs/guide.md": "f6e5d4c3b2a1..."
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-01-26T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### 9.3 Performance Optimization
- **Before**: 100 files → 100 DB operations (every sync)
- **After**: 3 changed files → 3 DB operations (97% reduction)
- **Force Sync**: `force=true` bypasses manifest for complete re-indexing

## 10. UI Requirements

### 10.1 Layout

| Area   | Width   | Content                            |
| ---- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| Left Pane | 20% | DocTree (shadcn/ui TreeView)        |
| Center   | 55% | MarkdownPane (react-markdown) |
| Right Pane | 25% | ChatPane (LLM Q&A)            |

### 10.2 Navigation Specifications

- **URL Integration**: File selection preserved in URL (`?file=path/to/doc.md`)
- **Browser Navigation**: Back/forward buttons work naturally
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic sync between URL and app state
- **Sharing**: Direct file access via URL sharing

### 10.3 Chat Specifications

- **Compact Design**: 12px base font, 8x8px avatars, 98% message width
- **Token Stream**: Display with SSE (0.1s buffer)
- **User Input**: `/chat` POST (JSON)
- **RAG Generation**: Claude Code SDK with document context
- **Layout**: Stacked avatar/role above message content for better space utilization

## 15. Current Work in Progress

### Oracle CLI Knowledge Enhancement (2025-08-01)

**Current Task**: Enhancing Oracle CLI specification validation capabilities through comprehensive knowledge update.

**Work Status**:
1. ✅ **Oracle CLI Knowledge Update**: Successfully updated knowledge base about Oracle CLI system including:
   - Command structure and available commands (status, lifecycle, integrity, utility)
   - Specification format v2 (YAML structure, naming conventions, directory hierarchy)
   - Bidirectional verification system (spec→code, code→spec)
   - Type constraint system (set-theoretic types, transformations, validations)
   - Integration with existing specmgr system

2. 🔄 **Current State Snapshot Creation** (In Progress): Creating comprehensive snapshot of current Oracle system state to enable:
   - Domain term consistency validation against current usage
   - Cross-reference validation against current file structure
   - Business rule completeness assessment based on current patterns
   - Implementation alignment verification using current references

**Current Challenge**: Moving from theoretical knowledge to practical validation by capturing the current state of:
- All specification files and their current format patterns
- Current ubiquitous language terms used across specifications  
- Current cross-reference patterns and dependencies
- Current directory structure and file organization
- Current domain terminology and business rules
- Current implementation file references

**Next Steps**:
- Complete current state knowledge snapshot
- Validate Oracle CLI format compliance capabilities
- Test validation accuracy against existing specifications

**Knowledge Gap Resolution**: Addressing the distinction between "恒久的な情報" (permanent/theoretical knowledge) vs "現時点での理解" (current state understanding) for more effective Oracle CLI validation.
