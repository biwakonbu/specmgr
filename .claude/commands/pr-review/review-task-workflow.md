description: Execute PR review tasks systematically using reviewtask
---

You are tasked with executing PR review tasks systematically using the reviewtask tool. 

## Available Commands:

The reviewtask tool provides the following commands for managing PR review tasks:

- **`reviewtask`** - Fetch latest PR reviews and generate/update tasks
- **`reviewtask status`** - Check overall task status and get summary
- **`reviewtask show`** - Get next recommended task based on priority
- **`reviewtask show <task-id>`** - Show detailed information for a specific task
- **`reviewtask update <task-id> <status>`** - Update task status
  - Status options: `todo`, `doing`, `done`, `pending`, `cancel`

### Task Completion Verification Commands:

- **`reviewtask verify <task-id>`** - Run verification checks before task completion
- **`reviewtask complete <task-id>`** - Complete task with automatic verification
- **`reviewtask complete <task-id> --skip-verification`** - Complete task without verification
- **`reviewtask config set-verifier <task-type> <command>`** - Configure custom verification commands
- **`reviewtask config show`** - Display current verification configuration

## Task Priority System:

Tasks are automatically assigned priority levels that determine processing order:
- **`critical`** - Security issues, critical bugs, breaking changes
- **`high`** - Important functionality issues, major improvements
- **`medium`** - Moderate improvements, refactoring suggestions
- **`low`** - Minor improvements, style suggestions

## Initial Setup (Execute Once Per Command Invocation):

**Fetch Latest Reviews**: Run `reviewtask` without arguments to fetch the latest PR reviews and generate/update tasks. This ensures you're working with the most current review feedback and tasks.

After completing the initial setup, follow this exact workflow:

## Workflow Steps:

1. **Check Status**: Use `reviewtask status` to check current task status and identify any tasks in progress
   - **If all tasks are completed (no todo, doing, or pending tasks remaining)**: Stop here - all work is done!
   - **If only pending tasks remain**: Review each pending task and decide action (see Step 2d)
   - **Continue only if todo, doing, or pending tasks exist**

2. **Identify Task**: 
   a) **Priority order**: Always work on tasks in this order:
      - **doing** tasks first (resume interrupted work)
      - **todo** tasks next (new work, prioritized by: critical → high → medium → low)
      - **pending** tasks last (blocked work requiring decision)
   
   b) **For doing tasks**: Continue with the task already in progress
   
   c) **For todo tasks**: 
      - First, evaluate if the task is needed using the **Task Classification Guidelines** below
      - If needed: Use `reviewtask show` to get the next recommended task, then run `reviewtask update <task-id> doing`
      - If duplicate/unnecessary: Update to `cancel`
      - If uncertain: Update to `pending`
   
   d) **For pending-only scenario**: 
      - List all pending tasks and their reasons for being blocked
      - For each pending task, decide:
        - `doing`: If you can now resolve the blocking issue
        - `todo`: If the task should be attempted again
        - `cancel`: If the task is no longer relevant or cannot be completed
      - Update task status: `reviewtask update <task-id> <new-status>`

3. **Verify Task Start**: Confirm the status change was successful before proceeding

4. **Execute Task**: Implement the required changes in the current branch based on the task description and original review comment

5. **Verify and Complete Task**: When implementation is finished:
   a) **Verify Implementation**: Run verification checks to ensure quality:
      - `reviewtask verify <task-id>` - Check if implementation meets verification requirements
      - If verification fails: Review and fix issues, then retry verification
      - If verification passes: Continue to completion
   
   b) **Complete Task**: Choose completion method:
      - **Recommended**: `reviewtask complete <task-id>` - Complete with automatic verification
      - **Alternative**: `reviewtask complete <task-id> --skip-verification` - Skip verification if needed
      - **Manual**: `reviewtask update <task-id> done` - Direct status update (no verification)
   - Commit changes using this message template (adjust language based on `user_language` setting in `.pr-review/config.json`):
     ```
     fix: [Clear, concise description of what was fixed or implemented]
     
     **Feedback:** [Brief summary of the issue identified in the review]
     The original review comment pointed out [specific problem/concern]. This issue 
     occurred because [root cause explanation]. The reviewer suggested [any specific 
     recommendations if provided].
     
     **Solution:** [What was implemented to resolve the issue]
     Implemented the following changes to address the feedback:
     - [Specific change 1 with file/location details]
     - [Specific change 2 with file/location details]
     - [Additional changes as needed]
     
     The implementation approach involved [brief technical explanation of how the 
     solution works].
     
     **Rationale:** [Why this solution approach was chosen]
     This solution was selected because it [primary benefit/advantage]. Additionally, 
     it [secondary benefits such as improved security, performance, maintainability, 
     code quality, etc.]. This approach ensures [long-term benefits or compliance 
     with best practices].

     ```

6. **Commit Changes**: After successful task completion, commit with proper message format

7. **Continue Workflow**: After committing:
   - Check status again with `reviewtask status`
   - **If all tasks are completed (no todo, doing, or pending tasks remaining)**: Stop here - all work is done!
   - **If only pending tasks remain**: Handle pending tasks as described in Step 2d
   - **If todo or doing tasks remain**: Repeat this entire workflow from step 1

## Task Classification Guidelines:

**CANCEL** tasks that are:
- Clear duplicates of already implemented features
- References to changes already completed in previous commits
- Obsolete suggestions that no longer apply to current code
- Tasks that would introduce conflicts with existing implementations

**PENDING** tasks that are:
- Ambiguous requirements that need clarification
- Low-priority improvements that could be done later
- Tasks dependent on external decisions or unclear specifications
- Enhancements that could be implemented but aren't critical

**TODO** tasks that are:
- New functional requirements not yet implemented
- Critical bug fixes or security issues
- Clear improvement suggestions for current code
- Tasks with specific actionable requirements

## AI Processing and Task Generation:

The reviewtask tool includes intelligent AI processing that:
- **Automatic Task Creation**: Analyzes PR review comments and automatically generates actionable tasks
- **Task Deduplication**: Identifies and removes duplicate or similar tasks to avoid redundant work  
- **Priority Assignment**: Automatically assigns priority levels based on comment content and context
- **Task Validation**: Ensures generated tasks are actionable and properly scoped

## Task Completion Verification:

The tool includes verification capabilities to ensure task quality before completion:

**Verification Types:**
- **Build Verification**: Runs build/compile checks (default: `go build ./...`)
- **Test Execution**: Runs test suites (default: `go test ./...`)
- **Code Quality**: Lint and format checks (default: `golangci-lint run`, `gofmt -l .`)
- **Custom Verification**: Project-specific commands based on task type

**Task Type Detection:**
Tasks are automatically categorized for custom verification:
- `test-task`: Tasks containing "test" or "testing"
- `build-task`: Tasks containing "build" or "compile"
- `style-task`: Tasks containing "lint" or "format"
- `bug-fix`: Tasks containing "bug" or "fix"
- `feature-task`: Tasks containing "feature" or "implement"
- `general-task`: All other tasks

**Configuration:**
- `reviewtask config show` - View current verification settings
- `reviewtask config set-verifier <task-type> <command>` - Set custom verification commands
- Verification settings stored in `.pr-review/config.json`

## Current Tool Features:

This workflow leverages the full capabilities of the current reviewtask implementation:
- **Multi-source Authentication**: Supports GitHub CLI, environment variables, and configuration files
- **Task Management**: Complete lifecycle management with status tracking and validation
- **Task Completion Verification**: Automated verification checks before task completion
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Intelligent task generation and classification
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive status reporting and workflow optimization

## Important Notes:
- Work only in the current branch
- Always verify status changes before proceeding
- Include proper commit message format with task details and comment references
- **Task Priority**: Always work on `doing` tasks first, then `todo` tasks (by priority level), then handle `pending` tasks
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Within todo tasks, process critical → high → medium → low priority items
- **Task Completion Verification**: Use `reviewtask complete <task-id>` for verified completion (recommended)
- **Verification Failure Handling**: If verification fails, fix issues and retry before completing
- **Verification Configuration**: Custom verification commands can be set per task type for project-specific requirements
- **Pending Task Management**: Pending tasks must be resolved by changing status to `doing`, `todo`, or `cancel`
- **Efficient Task Management**: Classify duplicate/unnecessary tasks as `cancel` and uncertain tasks as `pending` to focus on actionable work
- **Automatic Task Generation**: The tool intelligently creates tasks from review feedback with appropriate priorities
- Continue until all tasks are completed or no more actionable tasks remain
- The initial review fetch is executed only once per command invocation, not during the iterative workflow steps
